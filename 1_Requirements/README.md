## INTRODUCTION:
   With this Telecom Billing System, we can perform and manage billing operations like they do in Telecom companies. Here, we can add records with name, phone number and the amount of payment and we can view, modify, search and delete existing records. we can also make payment by providing our phone number instead of name. All data added or modified are recorded in a file. 

## Features:
•	Add new records: add new data into file with name, phone number and amount to be paid
•	View list of records – lists all telephone billing records 
•	Modify records – edit the added records; name, phone number and amount of payment can be edited
•	View payment – shows amount to be paid
•	Search records – search for added/updated records in file
•	Delete records – removes data permanently from file
